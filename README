USDA Modifiers
3/18/2013

This program is intended to serve as a simple example of how I use Python to
facilitate everyday language data collection tasks. It attempts to isolate the 
canonical form of each type of food in the USDA database, and provide a list of 
given modifiers for each food. The numword module is required to convert numbers
to words during the normalization process.
